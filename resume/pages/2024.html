 <p class="lokhunjan">During my time in a learnership at Coca-Cola Beverages South Africa, 
  I gained first-hand experience in the operational side of Manufacturing and Production. 
  I worked in a fast-paced, high pressure environment, which required me to adapt quickly, 
  think on my feet, and develop a strong work ethic.</p>
  <br/>
 <p>This experience taught me the importance of efficiency, precision and teamwork in 
  large-scale operations. i became familiar with the challenges of maintaining production 
  flow, ensuring  quality control and following strict safety and compliance standards. I
  also learned how to troubleshoot operational issues, communicate effectively with team 
  members and manage tasks under tight deadlines. </p>
  <br/>
  <p class="taught-me">What I learnt from this experience?</p>
 <br/>
 <ul class="ccbsa-list">
 <li class="list-item"><em>Operational Awareness: </em> I gained insight into manufacturing processes and the role of efficiency in large-scale production.</li>
 <li class="list-item"><em>Problem-Solving under pressure: </em> I developed the ability to troubleshoot issues quickly and adapt to unexpected challenges.</li>
 <li class="list-item"><em>Attention to Detail: </em>I learned to follow strict quality control and compliance procedures to maintain high production standards.</li>
 <li class="list-item"><em>Time Management: </em> Balanced multiple tasks in a fast-paced setting while ensuring productivity targets were met.</li>
 <li class="list-item"><em>Collaboration and Communication: </em> Worked closely with teams to ensure smooth workflow and effective coordination.</li>
 <li class="list-item"><em>Resilience and Adaptability: </em>I learned to handle physically demanding tasks while maintaining focus and efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>What I enjoyed most about this experience was being a part of the production process,
  from the very beginning, all the way to the end. It was the first time that I had 
  worked under such immense time pressure, and this allowed me to learn a lot about myself 
  and my capabilities. It allowed me to develop this aspect of myself and challenged me to
  become the best person I could be. This also opened my eyes to the endless opportunities 
  for innovation  within the production environment- an insight that went on to shape the 
  rest of my journey.
