    In the year 2022, I graduated with a Bachelor of Health Science in Biomedical Science, 
    majoring in Human Biology and Medical Cell Biology. This degree equipped me with in-depth 
    knowledge of human biology, disease mechanisms, and research methodologies, alongside hands-on 
    experience with advanced laboratory techniques.

<p>In Medical Cell Biology, I explored the intricate functions of cells and how they contribute to 
  health and disease. This included an in-depth study of neurobiology, the cardiovascular system, 
  cancer, and embryology. These areas helped me understand the mechanisms driving key physiological 
  and pathological processes, giving me insight into how cellular changes impact the body.</p>

<br/>
<p>In Human Biology, I studied the fascinating fields of paleontology, forensic science, anthropology, 
  and evolution, with a focus on the analysis of bones and their significance in understanding human 
  history. These subjects provided me with an appreciation for the diversity of life, human origins, 
  and the application of biological principles in solving modern forensic challenges.</p>

<p>These 3 years of my life I enjoyed immensely, but more importantly, I was able to 
  learn so much about myself and explore my capabilities. I was also able to develop key aspects of my 
  career. These include:</p>
<p>I am skilled in analyzing complex biological data and applying critical reasoning to solve scientific 
  and clinical problems.</p>
<p>I am experienced with advanced methods like PCR, ELISA, spectrophotometry, and microscopy.</p>
<p>I am competent in designing research projects, synthesizing scientific literature, and drawing 
  informed conclusions.</p>
<p>I offer interdisciplinary insight as I have a strong understanding of how biological concepts connect 
  with other fields, such as biotechnology, forensics, and anthropology.</p>
