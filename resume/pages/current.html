  <p>Having realized the potential of technology to drive efficiency and innovation, I was inspred to dive into coding and software development,
    where I am now building a strong foundation in programming, problem-solving and system design.</p>

    <p>I've been learning and working with various technologies, focusing on understanding how software can optimize processes, automate tasks,
      and solve real-world problems. 
    </p>
  <p>My background in Biomedical Science and FMCG operations gives me a unique perspective on problem-solving, and I'm excited to combine 
    these experiences to create effective solutions in the future.</p>

    <p>I am eager to continue to grow in the field of tech! My goal is to build software solutions that make processes more efficient, whether
      in production, healthcare, or beyond.
