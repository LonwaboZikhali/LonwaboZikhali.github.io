    In high school, I was really into life sciences, which eventually led me to 
    pursue a health science degree. I loved learning about how living systems 
    worked and figuring out how everything connected. That curiosity and interest 
    in problem-solving have stuck with me, even as my focus has shifted to 
    software engineering. Now, instead of studying cells and systems, I’m 
    building and troubleshooting software—but the same sense of curiosity drives 
    me.</p>
