  As part of a graduate program at a leading FMCG company, I gained firsthand experience in the fast-paced 
  world of consumer goods. My role involved understanding and optimizing business processes, which sharpened 
  my problem-solving skills and gave me insight into how efficiency and innovation drive success in the industry.

  This experience also ignited my interest in coding and software development. While exploring ways to improve 
  processes, I became fascinated by the role technology plays in modern operations. This curiosity motivated me 
  to begin pursuing a career in software engineering, combining my analytical mindset with a passion for creating 
  impactful solutions.
