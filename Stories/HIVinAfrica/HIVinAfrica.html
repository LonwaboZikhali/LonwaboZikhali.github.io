  <h2>HIV in Africa: A Personal Reflection on Progress and Hope</h2>
<section class="story">
<p>By Lonwabo Zikhali</p>

<p>When I first read about the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-hiv-aids-prevention-injectable-vaccine-9c5c8578f19f5e9f043f10d182fef2a0">
  rollout of a twice-yearly injectable for HIV prevention</a>, 
  I felt something deeper than professional interest. I felt pride. Pride in being South African, 
  and pride in how far we have come in confronting one of the most devastating epidemics our country has ever faced.</p>

<p>For South Africa, HIV has never been an abstract public health issue. It arrived with fear, 
  uncertainty, and silence. In its early years, HIV tore through communities faster than our 
  systems could respond. Families were hollowed out. Clinics were overwhelmed. Entire generations 
  grew up surrounded by loss. At a time when treatment options were limited, misinformation was 
  rampant, and stigma was lethal, an HIV diagnosis often felt like a death sentence.</p>

<p>This devastation is not just something we remember emotionally, it is visible in the data. 
  In my analytics work, when examining historical trends in HIV prevalence, mortality, and life 
  expectancy, the early 1990s and 2000s stand out starkly. Sharp rises in AIDS-related deaths, 
  collapsing life expectancy curves, and uneven access to treatment tell a clear story: the cost 
  of inaction, delay, and inequality was immense. Numbers, when handled honestly, do not soften 
  reality. They expose it.</p>

<p>That is why this moment matters.</p>

<p>A twice-yearly injectable represents more than a biomedical breakthrough. It represents a shift 
  in how we think about prevention. From something that relies heavily on daily compliance, 
  individual discipline, and uninterrupted access, to something that acknowledges real human lives. 
  Lives that are busy, complex, constrained, and often shaped by structural barriers.</p>

<p>For a country like South Africa where access gaps, stigma, and socioeconomic pressures have 
  historically shaped the trajectory of HIV, this is a big deal.</p>

<p>What makes this moment especially powerful is the contrast with where we started. Today, South 
  Africa runs the largest antiretroviral treatment programme in the world. AIDS-related deaths have 
  fallen dramatically from their peak. Mother-to-child transmission has been drastically reduced. 
  Life expectancy has rebounded. Viral suppression is now an achievable, measurable target rather 
  than a distant hope. These improvements are not accidental, they are the result of policy shifts, 
  scientific persistence, activism, community health workers, and relentless data-driven monitoring 
  of what works and what does not.</p>

<p>From an analytics perspective, this progress is visible as a slow but undeniable bending of the 
  curve. Declines in incidence. Improvements in retention in care. Better outcomes where interventions 
  are sustained. The data does not say the crisis is over but it says that progress is real.</p>

<p>The twice-yearly injectable feels like a light at the end of a very long tunnel. Not because it 
  erases the past, but because it honours it. It acknowledges the terror that once defined HIV in 
  South Africa, while refusing to let that terror define our future.</p>

<p>As a South African working at the intersection of data, technology, and health, this moment 
  reinforces why innovation matters and why it must be grounded in local realities. Science alone 
  does not change lives. Science, paired with access, equity, and informed decision-making does.</p>

<p>We are not at the end of the HIV story. But for the first time in a long time, the data, the 
  science, and the lived experience are pointing in the same direction: forward.</p>

<p>And that is something worth celebrating.</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<p>Below, I have some visuals to help illustrate the story. I built the visualisations in R to 
  explore trends, contrasts, and turning points in South Africa's HIV data using ggplot2, dplyr, 
  tidyr, and sf for spatial mapping.</p>

</div>
<br/>

<p>The map places South Africa in a continental context, showing how our HIV burden has historically 
  stood apart from many other African countries. It sets the scene that this is not just a regional 
  issue: South Africa has carried a uniquely heavy share of the epidemic.</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<div>
  <a id="univariate" class="visual" href="UnivariateStory.html">Top 10 Causes of Death in South Africa in 2006: a Univariate Story</a>
  </div>
  <br/>
  <p>This visual is one of the most confronting. It shows a period where HIV surpassed all other 
    causes of death combined, making the scale of the crisis impossible to downplay. It reflects 
    the years when HIV shaped national life expectancy, family structures, and health systems.</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<div>
  <a id="bivariate" class="visual" href="BivariateVisual.html">HIV During the Period: a Bivariate Story</a>
</div>
<br/>

<p>This is where the story shifts. The sharp decline in HIV-related deaths between 2007 and 2015 
  aligns with the large-scale rollout of antiretroviral therapy, expanded testing, stronger public 
  health policy, and improved access to care. While multiple factors are at play, the timing strongly 
  suggests that sustained treatment access and system-level intervention changed the trajectory and 
  saved millions of lives.</p>
