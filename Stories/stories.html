<h3>Here are some stories I've told</h3>
<section class="story">
<p>This section of my portfolio is dedicated to data-driven stories that sit at the intersection of 
  technology, analysis, and real-world impact. Each piece is an end-to-end project: from sourcing and 
  interrogating data, to designing visuals that communicate complex insights clearly and responsibly.
  The first story focuses on HIV in South Africa, examining national trends, provincial disparities, 
  and South Africa's position relative to other countries. The objective was not only to present 
  statistics, but to translate them into an accessible narrative that highlights both the scale of 
  the challenge and the progress made.</p>
  <p>Building this story strengthened my ability to work across the full analytics pipeline. I gained 
  practical experience in cleaning and structuring real-world datasets, making methodological choices 
  about aggregation and comparison, and designing visualisations that balance accuracy with clarity. 
  Just as importantly, it reinforced the importance of ethical, context-aware data communication when 
  working with sensitive public health topics.</p>
<p>Tech stack:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Data analysis & visualisation: R (tidyverse, ggplot2)</li>
  <li>Data sources: Public health and international development datasets</li>
  <li>Visual storytelling & presentation: Power BI (for interactive exploration)</li>
</ul>

<p>Future stories will expand on this approach, applying the same analytical and technical rigor to 
  other domains.</p>
