      <p>Affectionately known as Nwables, I am a fun-loving, food-adoring nature lover from the East Rand, South Africa. 
        I hold a Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Science, specializing in Human Anatomy.
        
        <p>I am currently pursuing a Diploma in Software Engineering. Some of my hobbies include playing Sudoku, 
        cooking and spending quality time with family. I aspire for a career in Data Science, 
        Mobile App Development, as well as Cybersecurity.</p>

    This is Mousey.
    </p>

  <p class="mouseyparagraph"> A game in which we feed a mouse some peanut butter, 
    ensuring that it doesn't die of hunger or get eaten by 
    a hungry cat. It's a Cat-Eat-Mouse world!
    </p>
    
  <p  class="mouseyparagraph">'Why peanut butter?' you may ask. I came across an 
    article that I particularly enjoyed reading that debunked 
    the theory of mice being obsessed with cheese. The 
    article can be found below:

  <p  class="mouseyparagraph"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.livescience.com/do-mice-really-like-cheese">https://www.livescience.com/do-mice-really-like-cheese</a>
  </p>
    
  <p  class="mouseyparagraph">An extract from the article:
  </p>
    
  <p  class="mouseyparagraph">"Instead, what house mice really seem to love is peanut 
    butter. "They have a good sense of smell, and it has a 
    pretty strong odor," Phifer-Rixey said. Plus, peanut 
    butter has plenty of protein and fat, which mice find 
    attractive, she added."
  </p>
    
  <p  class="mouseyparagraph">The game is a work-in-progress and I would appreciate 
    any feedback and suggestions you may have. I am 
    particularly looking into making the game mobile-friendly.
  </p>
    
  <p  class="mouseyparagraph">Happy Mouse-feeding!
